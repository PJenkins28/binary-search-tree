Binary Search Trees

Notes:

- Trees: Collection of elements that have links to each other; a non-linear hierarchical structure. Comprised of nodes (consist of the data value and a pointer that references other nodes).
- Binary Tree: A type of tree in which each node has a max of 2 immediate children; it is possible for the nodes to have one child or no children (making it a leaf node).
- Binary Search Tree: A tree that automatically stays sorted because it follows the rules that every left child be less than its parent and every right child be greater than its parent.
  -BSTs are balanced when left and right subtrees ahve roughly the same amount of nodes
